### What is it?
A path tracer using monte carlo simulation and physically based rendering.

### What can it do?
Render scenes with global illumination.

Texture mapping.

Multiple material types including a physically based material with roughness / metalness.

Meshes, spheres, planes.

Acceleration structure so I don't have infinitely long render times.

Image based lighting.

Cool.

### Why?
Because I am bored.

### Cool, show some pictures.

### How do I use it?
You shouldn't, this is a toy/learning project.
If you really want to, build with VS2017 and run either Raytracer.Core or Raytracer.Frontend. 

### (Insert other software) is faster and/or better.
Yes.
