### What is it?
A stochastic path tracer using monte carlo estimation to render realistic images with global illumination. Supports a PBR (physically based rendering) workflow.

### What can it do?
- Load and render scenes comprised of primitives and 3D models
- Support different material types for each object.
- Support for texture mapping.
- Next event estimation for direct light sampling.
- Acceleration structure so I don't have infinite render times.
- Image based lighting.

### Why?
Because I was bored.

### Cool, show some pictures.

### How do I use it?
You probably shouldn't, this is a toy/learning project.
If you really want to, build with VS2017 or later and run either Raytracer.Core or Raytracer.Frontend. 

### (Insert other software) is faster and/or better.
Probably.
